/*
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence begins with 'fibonacci(0) = 0' and 'fibonacci(1) = 1' as its respective
 * first and second terms. After these first two elements, each subsequent element is equal to
 * the sum of the previous two elements.
 *
 * Here is the basic information you need to calculate 'fibonacci(n)':
 * 'fibonacci(0) = 0'
 * 'fibonacci(1) = 1'
 * 'fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)'
 *
 * Given 'n', complete the fibonacci function so it returns 'fibonacci(n)'. 'n' will be greater
 * than or equal to 0 and less than 40.
 *
 * Constraints: Your fibonacci implementation must have O(n) time complexity and use recursion.
