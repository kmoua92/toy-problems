 * Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their
 * respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your
 * phone book for.
 *
 * Return an array that contains a result for each name in 'queries'. If there is an associated
 * entry in your phone book, populate your result array with the phone book entry in the form of
 * 'name=phoneNumber'. If an entry for name is not found, populate your result array with
 * 'Not found' instead.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * var phoneNumberString = 
 *   'sam 99912222
 *    tom 11122222
 *    harry 12299933';
 * 
 * dictionariesAndMaps(3, phoneNumberString, ['sam', 'edward', 'harry'])
 * // returns --> ['sam=99912222', 'Nof found', 'harry=12299933']
 *
